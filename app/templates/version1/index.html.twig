** Public API v1 **

Usage:

The API follows the general pattern of enumerating possible values of the
subsequent path segment, with the fully qualified path yielding a json object
of the type being enumerated.

For example, /v1/anime will yield:
  [1, 2, 3, ... ]

which can be used to create the fully qualified path of:
  /v1/anime/1

The following paths are exposed by this API:

{% for routes in routes %}
    {{ routes }}
{% endfor %}

Key:
  l : locale aware (via ?lang=<langId>)
  d : currently disabled
  a : requires authentication

Locale:

APIs which are locale aware accept the ?lang=<langId> option. For example:
  /v1/anime/1?lang=fr

Possible locale 'langId' values include:
  en
  es
  de
  fr
  zh

Bulk expansion:

Many APIs offer bulk expansion. APIs that offer bulk expansion will provide a list of
possible IDs when no parameters are provided. As set of ids can be then be resolved into
objects via one of four methods. The simplest is by specifying multiple ids via query
parameter, as in:

  /v1/anime?ids=1,2,3

Individual ids may also be requested via

  /v1/anime/1
  /v1/anime?id=1

Some endpoints support returning all resources. To do this, one may also specify 'all'
to expand all ids. For example:

  /v1/anime?ids=all

Not all APIs support the 'all' keyword as it may be too expensive.

Another approach to bulk expansion is through pages.  Use the ?page=<page#>
parameter to specify the requeste page.  Optionally, you can also provide
a &page_size=<page size> value to adjust to your preferred page size.

Sample usage is:

  /v1/anime?page=0&page_size=10

Pay attention to response headers which provide additional metadata about
the underlying collection, pagination info, and links.

Authentication:

APIs which require authentication need to be passed an API key belonging to
the account to be accessed. The API key must have the appropriate permissions
associated with it (/v2/tokeninfo can be used to inspect key permissions). Keys
can be generated on the ArenaNet account site.

Keys can be passed either via query parameter or HTTP header. Our servers do
not support preflighted CORS requests, so if your application is running
in the user's browser you'll need to user the query parameter.

To pass via query parameter, include "?access_token=<API key>" in your request.

To pass via HTTP header, include "Authorization: Bearer <API key>".
