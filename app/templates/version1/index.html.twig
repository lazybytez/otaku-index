** Public API v1 **

Usage:

The API follows the general pattern of enumerating possible values of the
subsequent path segment, with the fully qualified path yielding a json object
of the type being enumerated.

For example, /v1/anime will yield:
    [1, 2, 3, ... ]

which can be used to create the fully qualified path of:
    /v1/anime/1

Individual ids may also be requested via:
    /v1/anime?id=1

And also bulk expansion is offered:
    /v1/anime?ids=1,2,3

The following paths are exposed by this API:
============================================

{% for routes in routes %}
    {{ routes.name }} [{{ routes.method[0] }}]
{% endfor %}
