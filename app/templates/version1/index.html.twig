** Public API v1 **

Usage:

The API follows the general pattern of enumerating possible values of the
subsequent path segment, with the fully qualified path yielding a json object
of the type being enumerated.

For example, /v1/anime will yield:
  [1, 2, 3, ... ]

which can be used to create the fully qualified path of:
  /v1/anime/1

The following paths are exposed by this API:

{% for routes in routes %}
    {{ routes.name }} [{{ routes.method[0] }}]
{% endfor %}

Keys:

  a -> requires authentication

MORE INFOS WILL COME!!!
